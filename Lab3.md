# Lab 3: Deployment Tools in Agile

## OBJECTIVES
To understand and use deployment tools that help automate the process of delivering software in Agile development.

## INTRODUCTION
In Agile, code is released frequently. Deployment tools help automate the process of building, testing, and launching software, ensuring faster and more reliable delivery.

## TOOLS USED
- **GitHub** – code hosting
- **Netlify** – deploy frontend websites
- **Heroku** – deploy backend apps
- **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD automation

## STEPS

### Netlify (Frontend Deployment)
1. Created simple HTML website
2. Pushed code to GitHub
3. Connected repo to Netlify
4. Netlify auto-deploys the site on each commit

### Heroku (Backend Deployment)
1. Created Node.js Express API
2. Added Procfile for Heroku config
3. Pushed code using Heroku CLI
4. Live backend hosted on Heroku

### GitHub Actions (Automation)
1. Created `.yml` workflow file
2. Automated tasks on git push (like testing or build)

## RESULT
Successfully deployed frontend and backend apps with automation. Understood how deployment tools support Agile principles of fast, continuous delivery.

## CONCLUSION
Deployment tools like Netlify, Heroku, and GitHub Actions help teams deliver updates quickly and safely, supporting Agile practices.
